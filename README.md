## Deployment Link : https://jolly-figolla-271fa4.netlify.app/

## Environment Setup : 
  Download vscode via https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  choose appropriate link based on your system OS
## Installing Node.....
To install Node.js on your machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/.
2. On the homepage, you will see two versions available for download: LTS (Long-Term Support) and Current. It is recommended to choose the LTS version for stability unless you have a specific reason to use the Current version.
3. Click on the LTS button to download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
4. Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.
5. During the installation, you may be asked to choose various options. The default settings should work fine for most users, so you can typically proceed with the default options.
6. After the installation is complete, you can verify that Node.js is installed correctly by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing the following command:

### node --version

7. Additionally, you can also check the version of npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command:

### npm --version

   This should display the version number of npm installed on your machine.
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
